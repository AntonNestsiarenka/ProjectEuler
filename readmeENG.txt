The ProjectEuler module provides methods for solving specific tasks from the collection: Euler Project.
All functions used are implemented in a separate module euler_project. Documentation is written for each function.

Currently, ProjectEuler provides solutions to 14 tasks. A description is written for each task.
To display the result in the console of a specific task, you need to call its corresponding function.
Functions for tasks are written in the same style as "taskX", where X is the number of the task. To view the runtime
of the task code, you need to place the taskX () call function between the line start_time = datetime.now () and print ('{} {}'. format ('Lead time:', datetime.now () - start_time)).
If possible, solutions to new problems will be added to this module.
When there are more solutions, I’ll make a file with answers for each task, where everyone can see and check themselves or me =)
